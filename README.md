- 📥 Download encrypted/decrypted text to file

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### Caesar Cipher
A method in which each letter in the message is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

### El-Gamal Encryption
El-Gamal is a public-key used for secure data encryption and key exchange based on the discrete logarithm problem.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
- **Utilities:** Custom-built El-Gamal & Caesar Cipher logic
- **Icons:** Lucide-react
